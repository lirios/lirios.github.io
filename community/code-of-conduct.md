In the Liri community, participants from all over the world come
together to create Free Software for the desktop, most specifically
a desktop operating system. This is made possible by the support,
hard work and enthusiasm of the people involved, including those who
created and use Liri.  However, with that comes a responsibility to
follow a predefined set of rules that ensures the best experience
for all the people involved. This document offers some guidance
to ensure participants can cooperate effectively in a positive and
inspiring atmosphere, and to explain how together we can strenghten
and support each other.

## I. Be considerate

Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend
on the work and actions of others. Any decision you take will affect
other community members, and we expect you to take those consequences
into account when making decisions.
As a contributor, ensure that you give full credit for the work of
others and bear in mind how your changes affect others. It
is also expected that you try to follow the development schedule and
guidelines.  As a user, remember that contributors work hard on their
part of Liri and take great pride in it. If you are frustrated your
problems are more likely to be resolved if you can give accurate and
well-mannered information to all concerned.

## II. Be respectful

In order for the Liri community to stay healthy its members must
feel comfortable and accepted. Treating one another with respect is
absolutely necessary for this. In a disagreement, in the first instance
assume that people mean well.  We do not tolerate personal attacks,
racism, sexism or any other form of discrimination. Disagreement is
inevitable, from time to time, but respect for the views of others
will go a long way to winning respect for your own view. Respecting
other people, their work, their contributions and assuming well-meaning
motivation will make community members feel comfortable and safe and
will result in motivation and productivity.  We expect members of
our community to be respectful when dealing with other contributors,
users and communities. Remember that Liri is a project open to
people from all over the world of varying ages, beliefs and levels
of maturity and that you may be unaware of important aspects of
other cultures.  Also you must be conscious of the content you
produce and remarks you make. No nudity, excess vulgarity,
political content, religious content, or inappropriate content should
appear in relation to Liri. Ultimately, the Liri moderators have
the final say as to what constitutes as inappropriate. If in doubt,
consider whether or not it's something you'd show to a
room full of people including children and grandmothers from around
the world. If you're hesitant, don't do it.

## III. Be collaborative

Collaboration is central to Liri and to the larger
Free Software community: it helps limit duplication of effort
while improving the quality of the software produced. In order to
avoid misunderstanding, try to be clear and concise when requesting
help or giving it. Remember it is easy to misunderstand emails
(especially when they are not written in your mother tongue). Ask
for clarifications if unsure how something is meant; remember the
first rule - assume in the first instance that people mean well.
As a contributor, you should aim to collaborate with other community
members, as well as with other communities that are interested in
or depend on the work you do. Your work should be transparent and
be fed back into the community when available, not just when Liri
releases. If you wish to work on something new in existing projects,
keep those projects informed of your ideas and progress.  It may not
always be possible to reach consensus on the implementation of an
idea, so don't feel obliged to achieve this before you begin. However,
always ensure that you keep the outside world informed of your work,
and publish it in a way that allows outsiders to test, discuss and
contribute to your efforts.  Contributors on every project come and
go. When you leave or disengage from the project, in whole or in part,
you should do so with pride about what you have achieved and by acting
responsibly towards others who come after you to continue the project.
As a user, your feedback is important, as is its form. Poorly thought
out comments can cause pain and the demotivation of other community
members, but considerate discussion of problems can bring positive
results. An encouraging word works wonders.

## IV. Be pragmatic

Liri is a pragmatic community. We value tangible results over having the
last word in a discussion. We defend our core values like freedom
and respectful collaboration, but we don't let arguments about minor
issues get in the way of achieving more important results. We are open
to suggestions and welcome solutions regardless of their origin. When
in doubt support a solution which helps getting things done over one
which has theoretical merits, but isn't being worked on. Use the tools
and methods which help getting the job done. Let decisions be taken
by those who do the work.

## V. Consequences

This Code of Conduct is shared by all contributors and users who
engage with the Liri team in any forum, mailing list, wiki, web site,
IRC channel, public events or private correspondence. Liri governance
bodies will arbitrate in any dispute over the conduct of a member of
the community. If you choose not to follow this Code of Conduct, we
reserve the right
to: alter or remove any content you've posted; deactivate
your account on the website; kick you out of an IRC channel; ban
you from the site, IRC channels, or related services; or otherwise
prevent you from interacting with the community.
